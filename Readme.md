This project utilizes React.
It must be launched from a server like Vercel to have React functionality.
The project creates an environment where users can create decks of flashcards to review any information they would like to memorize. 
The user has the ability to add and edit both decks and cards and review the content in a linear fashion. 
The program has a number of controls to ensure that the user has enough content to study and that they are presented with the flashcards from query to solution, as well as easy direction toward adding cards if there are not enough available.
Much of the program relies on React rendering to display the various functional windows of the user experience.
